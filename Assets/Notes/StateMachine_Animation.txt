State Machines (FSM - Finite State Machines)

---

What are they?
• Computational patterns that are used to define the model state behavior of a system.
• They are built of afinite number of states (think of this as the behavior of the machine at a certain point) with some transitions between them when certain conditions are met.
• Because they are aware of both the internal and external world, they become very flexible to player actions.
• We will be mostly using deterministic versions which allows you to change states with a certain degree of randomness.
• Why?
	- Let's us specify the general structure of behavior (like Scriptable 	  Objects, these are blueprints for doing actions)
	- Allows us to visually see how different states connect to each other
	- Very useful for creating complex AI with simple behavior
